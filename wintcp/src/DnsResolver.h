// Asynchronous reverse-DNS for remote endpoints: a dedicated
// worker thread resolves PTR records with getnameinfo(NI_NAMEREQD) while
// the UI thread keeps painting. Results (positive and negative) are cached
// per address; each result is delivered to a sink running on the worker
// thread, which normally posts it to the window.
//
// Known trade-off: getnameinfo has no timeout parameter, so the lookup is
// run on a *detached helper thread* per address, and the worker bounds its
// wait to a per-tick budget (kDnsTimeoutDefault, tunable via --dns-timeout).
// A lookup that exceeds the budget is reported back as "pending" - the cell
// shows `host: pending` instead of `—` - and the worker moves on to the
// next address WITHOUT being blocked by the stalled query. The helper
// thread runs to completion in the background and silently caches its result
// when it returns. This is the same "one stuck call costs one helper thread
// instead of the whole pool" shape SocketTrafficSampler uses for stalled
// getproc/GetExtendedTcpTable calls (see SocketTraffic.cpp:816).
//
// 9.2.8: the old header claimed a cancellation timeout was impossible and
// that a worker pool would multiply DNS load for no win. That is no longer
// the shape: the worker stays single-threaded, the budget is a per-lookup
// ceiling (not the wait itself - the wait is the budget), and a one-shot CLI
// pass that asks for --dns still blocks for its answers (Lookup is still
// synchronous for the command line), but the GUI's refresh never stalls on a
// wedged resolver. A one-line advisory is emitted on stderr when lookups
// are abandoned as stalled, so a script reading stdout still sees a clean
// table and the count of pending lookups lives on stderr.
