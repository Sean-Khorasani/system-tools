// 9.5.5 - the exposure badge's decision half.
//
// The badge answers one question: is there a listening socket reachable from
// somewhere other than this machine? Recipe 24 names the red case - a
// listener on 0.0.0.0:443 owned by System and unsigned - and that is the case
// this module is built around.
//
// WHY A PURE MODULE AND NOT A NEW COLUMN. COL_COUNT is exactly 32 and
// static_assert(COL_COUNT <= 32) is a deliberate design decision; a 33rd
// column requires the eight-part UINT64 mask change (mask, REG_BINARY,
// kCurrentColVersion migration, IDM_COL range, ColumnTitle / GetColumnText /
// CompareRows / JsonKeyFor, GroupedDefaultColumns, the help prose) that the
// architecture note forbids arriving as a side effect. So the badge lives on
// the status bar, where it costs nothing and cannot break the mask - and the
// decision itself lives here, pure and pinned, because "which rows count as
// exposed" is a predicate the same shape as every other engine predicate in
// this tree.
//
// THE THREE AXES, and each is load-bearing on its own:
//
//   1. THE ADDRESS. 0.0.0.0 and :: are not "no address"; they are the
//      wildcard, and a wildcard bind is reachable from anywhere. A listener
//      on a specific routable address is ALSO reachable from outside. Only
//      loopback is not. So the predicate distinguishes all three rather than
//      treating "non-loopback" as one bucket.
//
//   2. THE PORT. A wildcard bind on :443 is something someone chose to
//      expose to the internet; a wildcard bind on :51593 is a CI test server
//      that will be gone tomorrow. The port is what makes a wildcard listener
//      worth a human's attention, and it is what separates kPublic from the
//      red case.
//
//   3. THE OWNER. A listener owned by System (a service) and carrying an
//      unsigned image is the classic "something is listening and nobody
//      vouched for it". The two owner flags travel with the row rather than
//      into the scoring, because a caller may weigh them differently: the
//      status bar wants to know which of its listeners is the alarming one,
//      and re-deriving the owner here would hide the very combination the
//      caller is trying to show.
