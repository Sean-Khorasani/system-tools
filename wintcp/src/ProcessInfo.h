// COLUMN": a per-connection thread cannot be had. MIB_TCPROW_OWNER_PID - the row
// behind GetExtendedTcpTable(TCP_TABLE_OWNER_PID_ALL), which is this app's
// whole basis - has no thread id, and an AFD endpoint is owned by the PROCESS,
// not by a thread. There is nothing to put in such a column. What a process does
// have is a list of threads, and that is the thing worth showing.
//
// Every field below comes from a DOCUMENTED user-mode API. Notably absent is the
// thread's current state: GetThreadInfo/THREADINFO is a legacy kernel32 export
// that the Windows SDK no longer declares for user mode, and its state and
// wait-reason enumerators are not published - so a "Waiting/Running" column would
// mean inventing a mapping. Better absent than wrong. The facts below answer
// "what is this process doing" without it: which threads exist, which have
// burned CPU, and since when.
//
// cpu100ns and create100ns are raw 100ns counts since 1601 (CPU is kernel+user
// since thread start), left unformatted so this header holds no display policy.
// timesKnown false means OpenThread or GetThreadTimes was refused - a real
// condition for protected processes, which must render as unknown, never as zero.

// The threads of 'pid', as last sampled.
//
// WHY IT IS CACHED AND WHY IT IS ASYNCHRONOUS. Measured on this machine rather
// than estimated: CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPTHREAD) costs ~48 ms, and
// the per-thread work on top is negligible by comparison (39 threads 49 ms, 456
// threads 54 ms - the cost is the kernel-wide walk, not the threads). Details
// rebuilds its model on every refresh tick, on the UI thread, so calling this
// inline would freeze the window for 48 ms every two seconds for as long as
// Details is open.
//
// So the snapshot is taken on a private worker and published under a lock, and
// this function returns the last published value immediately: it NEVER blocks on
// the snapshot. A caller arriving before the first result gets an empty list and
// known=false, which must be rendered as "not read yet" - a process always has at
// least one thread, so the empty reading is a falsehood.
//
// 'ageMs' receives how long ago the returned sample was taken, so a caller can
// say so instead of implying the numbers are current. UINT_MAX when unknown.
//
// 'allowBlocking' exists for the ONE-SHOT caller. A GUI that polls this
// every couple of seconds is always served from the last published snapshot
// and never waits - but a command such as `wintcp.exe details` runs once and
// exits, so "nothing published yet" would mean it NEVER prints the section.
// Measured, that bug looked exactly like "the feature does not work": the
// first and only call returned an empty list and the process ended. So a
// one-shot caller opts in to paying the ~48 ms inline, which for a command
// that is about to exit anyway is the better trade by three orders of
// magnitude.
