//
//   CLI    0/1/2/3 exactly as above. RunCli returns these and nothing else.
//   GUI    0 after the message loop; 1 for each of its three startup
//          failures (WSAStartup, RegisterClassEx, window Create). So the GUI's
//          1 means "never got a window", NOT the CLI's "failed" - and no
//          script can observe it, because the CLI is the only front end a
//          script runs.
//   bench  0 all green, 1 any check failed. Again not the CLI's 1.
//
// The collision is harmless precisely because it is unobservable, and it is
// written down here so that "which 1 is this?" is answerable rather than a
// thing a reader has to infer from wmain. main.cpp returns its own literals
// rather than these constants, and that is deliberate: naming them kExitFail
// would assert that "the window did not open" and "the command failed" are the

// a future second front end cannot invent a second set. The `help` prose

// One command invocation. Text is UTF-8, ready to print; the CLI writes out
// and err to stdout/stderr, the GUI renders them into dialogs/status.
//
// TWO RULES about these two strings, both previously only followed in practice.
//
// 1. LINE ENDINGS ARE PER-CHANNEL, and the split is not arbitrary.
//    `err` is human prose for a terminal, so every message ends "\r\n". `out`
//    is a DATA FEED, so it uses whatever the chosen format specifies: JSON,
//    JSON-lines and CSV all use a bare "\n" separator and terminator, because
//    that is what those formats are defined to use and a conforming parser
//    handles either. Measured across Commands.cpp: 134 "\r\n" and 22 bare
//    "\n", and all 22 are in the JSON/CSV renderers. None is in `err`.
//
// 2. `err` IS ASSIGNED, NOT APPENDED, EXCEPT WHERE YOU ARE ADDING A WHOLE
//    NEW MESSAGE. Assignment owns the whole string, so an `err = ` inside a
//    conditional silently discards whatever an earlier branch wrote. There is
//    exactly ONE place in Commands.cpp that appends - the advisory merge in the
//    list path - and it is guarded on emptiness, which is what keeps the
//    separator honest. Two messages that both end in a newline need no
//    separator work at all, which is why `err` messages all end in "\r\n":
//    that is what makes append safe by construction.
//
// A message that does NOT end in a newline breaks both rules at once: appending
// runs it into the next message, and printing it leaves the cursor mid-line.

// ---- capture (follow stream) -----------------------------------------------
//
// `capture` grew from "print some counters" into the command-line replacement
// for the GUI's Follow TCP stream, which was removed 2026-10-05 (todo.md 8.7
// G2). The three switches below are that replacement, and the reasons they are
// switches rather than defaults are worth keeping:
//
//   text  - the payload was already in memory and was being thrown away. On the
//           command line, printing it costs nothing extra and makes the verb
//           worth running without piping into anything.
//   out   - the capture file was deleted immediately after parsing. Saving it is
//           the difference between "here are the bytes" and "here is the
//           capture, open it in Wireshark".
//   dir   - a stream has two halves and most questions are about one of them.
//           Default is both, because guessing for the user is worse than
//           printing twice.
struct CaptureOptions {
    // Print the reassembled stream to stdout as a hex dump, one block per
    // direction (or just the one --dir selects).
    bool text = false;
    // Dump the raw reassembled stream bytes to outPath (binary, no hex/pcapng
    // framing). Requires outPath; mutually exclusive with text.
    bool bin = false;
    // Save the capture as pcapng here. Empty = do not keep it.
    std::wstring outPath;
    // R4: the pcapng write is CREATE_ALWAYS, so an existing file at outPath
    // would be destroyed silently. Same convention as export: refuse without
    // this, and the CLI's --force is what sets it.
    bool forceOverwrite = false;
    // Which half --text prints. Parsed by ParseCaptureDir.
    std::wstring dir = L"both";
    // pktmon `start --flags N` mask (SYN/FIN/RST). 0 = record everything
    // (the default and the only mode that fully reassembles). Parsed by
    // ParseCaptureFlags. Named constant lives in StreamCapture.h; the struct
    // default stays a literal 0 so this header does not need to include it.
    unsigned eventFlags = 0;

    // 9.3.7: an extra `pktmon filter add -i <ip>` address pin, passed through
    // verbatim. Empty = do not add one, keeping the default single-connection
    // filter pktmon derives from the selected row. Validated as an IP in
    // CmdCapture, so the executor never ships a malformed token to pktmon.

// ---- change events ---------------------------------------------------------

// (nullptr = no filter) keeps only events whose row matches, so
// `list --watch --changes --filter ...` watches a subset.
//
// 'eventMask' selects which kinds are printed, as a bitmask of RowChangeKind
// (1<<kChangeAppear | 1<<kChangeDisappear | 1<<kChangeState). It is applied
// BEFORE the row filter, so asking for APPEAR only costs nothing and shows
// nothing else. kAllChangeKinds is the default and reproduces the old
// behaviour exactly. This is what answers "what opened while I was away" - the
// single most valuable question for an event feed - which was previously not
// expressible at all.

// Declared here, and not left as a private helper in Commands.cpp, for one
// reason: it is pure formatting over two reassembled directions, and the
// repository's convention is that pure logic gets tested rather than trusted
// (see SocketTraffic.h's "split out for --selftest"). The test drives the real
// captured ClientHello that Bench.cpp already carries.
//
// It is here, and only here, because it is the only place a TLS session can be
// reported at all. Windows has no socket-level TLS ioctl - no SIO_TLS_INFO
// exists in the SDK, and TCP_INFO_v0 carries no TLS field - so the handshake
// bytes are the only source, and they are readable only for a connection the
// user chose to capture. The `tls` column therefore stays unpopulated; see the
// TlsInfo comment in Connection.h.
