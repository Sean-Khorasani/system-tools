// ViewState.h
// What to show: filter, sort, grouping, freeze, column set. One struct, shared
// by the GUI's live view and by a saved preset.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. "Which rows are visible, in what order, in what shape" is
// currently decided in two places that must agree and are not connected: a
// MainWindow member per axis (filterProgram_, groupByProcess_, frozen_, the
// sort through ConnectionStore) and PresetView, which stores a second,
// near-identical copy of most of the same decisions. Two descriptions of one
// view is two things to forget to update - the same class of fault that let
// GeoIP (778 lines, fully tested, never called) and 5.1 grouping (tested,
// wired to nothing) ship dead.
//
// So there is one type. A preset stores this; the GUI holds this; the CLI
// builds this from flags. PresetView is gone rather than kept in sync, because
// "in sync" is exactly the property that does not survive a refactor.
//
// THE INVARIANT. ViewState::ApplyTo is the ONLY place a view is built. The GUI
// must not assemble a ViewQuery itself, and the CLI must not either - both call
// ApplyTo. That is what makes a command testable without a window, and what
// stops the two front ends drifting (the fault that already cost one round:
// the CLI had a private copy of the snapshot pipeline and had silently drifted
// from the GUI's).
//
// NO HWND APPEARS HERE, AND NONE MAY BE ADDED. That is the whole point.

// defaults and its own copy of the concepts. It is kept as a type alias so
// Presets.cpp, Settings.cpp and MainWindow.cpp keep compiling, but it is no
// longer a separate description: a preset IS a ViewState.
//
// ONE FIELD WAS RENAMED: PresetView::sortCol is ViewState::sortColumn. The
// alias could not have preserved the old name without a wrapper struct, and a
// wrapper struct is precisely the second description this file exists to
// delete. Three call sites in Presets.cpp and two in MainWindow.cpp were
// updated; the registry schema did NOT change, so every preset saved by an
// earlier build still loads.
//
// Note what this does NOT do: the GUI-only axes (frozen, preserveSelection) are
// present on the type but not persisted by Presets::Save, which writes a named
// subset of fields. That asymmetry is deliberate, and is why merging these two
// types was safe at all: the on-disk schema is untouched.

// A saved preset IS a ViewState.
