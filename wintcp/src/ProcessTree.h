// 9.5.6 - the process tree.
//
// `ppid` and `parent` describe a row's parent; this answers the two questions
// those cannot: "what did this process start" (the descendants) and "kill this
// process and everything under it".
//
// Both halves are here, pure, because the interesting part is neither the
// Toolhelp snapshot nor the TerminateProcess handle - it is the shape of the
// tree and the rules for walking it. Those are pure functions over the rows
// the store already holds, which means they are testable without spawning
// anything and without an elevation prompt.
//
// THREE RULES the implementation follows, each learned from a way this can go
// wrong, and each pinned by the selftest:
//
//   1. A CYCLE IS REFUSED, not followed. Windows PIDs can form a spurious
//      cycle when a process is being torn down and its parent field is stale.
//      Following one produces an infinite list or a stack overflow, so
//      BuildProcessTree detects the back-edge and breaks it.
//
//   2. ROOT selection is explicit, NOT "PPID 0". A process whose parent has
//      already exited is re-parented and its PPID can be a recycled number,
//      which is how "the tree" comes to contain a row that is nobody's parent
//      and nobody's child. A root is a row that no OTHER row in the set
//      claims as its parent.
//
//   3. DEPTH IS BOUNDED. A deep chain (a service host spawning services that
//      spawn services) is legal, but an unbounded recursion is not - so the
//      walk has an explicit ceiling and reports it rather than truncating
//      silently.

// The decision half of a kill-tree: WHICH processes die, in what order, and

// parent). Killing a parent first orphans its children, and an orphaned child
// can be re-parented to something else or survive as a zombie; killing the
// leaves first means every process still has a living parent to answer to
// when it dies, which is the order a user expects from "kill the tree".
