// Per-PID traffic counters: a real-time consumer of the ETW
// NT Kernel Logger with EVENT_TRACE_FLAG_NETWORK_TCPIP. Counts bytes per
// PID from the classic MOF TcpIp/UdpIp send/receive events.
//
// Starting the kernel logger needs Administrator rights; on a normal
// user session Start() fails with a human-readable reason and the rest
// of the application works unchanged (graceful fallback: a non-admin
// per-socket source sits underneath, see SocketTraffic.h).
//
// Payload research (MSDN MOF classes): every relevant event begins with
//   uint32 PID;   // offset 0
//   uint32 size;  // offset 4
// regardless of protocol/address family, so only those 8 bytes are read;
// addresses/ports are irrelevant for per-PID accounting.
//
// Event type location - PROVEN on this machine (elevated probe,
// 40443 events): classic MOF events carry their type (10 = send v4,
// 11 = receive v4, 26/27 = v6 send/receive; EVENT_TRACE_TYPE_SEND/
// RECEIVE from evntrace.h) in EventDescriptor.**Opcode** while
// EventDescriptor.**Id** is always 0. The original consumer filtered on
// Id and therefore silently discarded every event - that was the
// "running as administrator still shows empty cells" defect. The pure
// helpers below encode the fix and are exercised by --selftest.
// Provider GUIDs:
//   TcpIp {9a280ac0-c8e0-11d1-84e2-00c04fb998a2} / UdpIp {bf3a50c5-...}
