// 9.4.2 - the buttons half of empty states.
//
// MainWindow::UpdateEmptyState already says the reason (one actionable
// sentence per case, NO ROWS > DATABASE > TRAFFIC). The ticket also wants
// BUTTONS alongside it: [Run as admin], [Clear], [Edit], [Pick .mmdb].
//
// This is the decision half, pure and tested, so the wiring in MainWindow is a
// thin hook. Same split as every other module here (FilterClause is the
// precedent): the predicate the window runs is the predicate the selftest
// pins, and there is no second copy in the window to drift from it.
//
// TWO RULES the button set follows, both learned from the window:
//
//   1. [Run as admin] only ever appears when the process is NOT already
//      elevated. Offering "restart with more rights" to a process that already
//      has them is a button that does nothing - and a user who clicks it and
//      sees nothing happen has been lied to. `doctor` reports elevation, and
//      the empty-state message already says "(needs admin)", so the honest
//      thing is to show the button only in the case where the click works.
//
//   2. The precedence is the one UpdateEmptyState already uses: NO ROWS
//      first, then DATABASE, then TRAFFIC. Keeping the order is what stops the
//      two from disagreeing about which case the window is in.
