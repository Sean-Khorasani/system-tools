// TRUTH ABOUT IPv6 TEARDOWN, as verified against the Windows 10/11 SDK
// headers (um\iphlpapi.h) rather than assumed:
//
//   * SetTcpEntry(_In_ PMIB_TCPROW) is the *only* connection-state mutator in
//     iphlpapi.h. Its comment block states outright: "The only state that it
//     can be set to is MIB_TCP_STATE_DELETE_TCB."
//   * There is no SetTcpEntry2, no SetTcp6Entry, and no IPv6 variant of the
//     MIB_TCPROW setter anywhere in the SDK. A recursive search of every
//     header in Include\10.0.26100.0 for SetTcpEntry2 / SetTcp6Entry returns
//     nothing. MIB_TCP6ROW is enumerated (GetTcp6Table) and owns-module lookup
//     works (GetOwnerModuleFromTcp6Entry) but it is never accepted as
//     teardown input.
//   * SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats does take a PMIB_TCP6ROW, but it only sets
//     per-connection EStats (the TCP_ESTATS_TYPE set in shared\tcpestats.h -
//     data, send congestion, path, buffers, observed RTT, bandwidth, fine RTT).
//     It has no state/delete semantics; there is nothing to smuggle a
//     DELETE_TCB through it.
//
// So there is no supported public per-connection IPv6 teardown. The options
// that do exist (closing a duplicated socket handle, or a WFP callout that
// injects RST) are privileged, race with the connection already being gone,
// and are not a supported API contract. This module does not pretend
// otherwise: SetIpv6Teardown returns false with an explicit reason and
// BlockConnection then reports kRulesOnly rather than claiming a kill.

// Kill the live IPv4 TCP connection identified by the 4-tuple (localPort,
// remoteAddr, remotePort). 'remoteAddr' is 4 raw network-order bytes.
// 'localAddr' may be null to mean "any local address", which is what
// BlockConnection does: BlockRequest deliberately does not carry a local
// address, and a machine may hold the same local port bound to several
// addresses, so every matching row is torn down rather than leaving a sibling
// socket alive after the user asked for the connection to be gone.
// Returns false for a zero port or unspecified remote address, and for a
// connection that is no longer present.

// ========================================================================
// 9.5.5 - the firewall manager's rule layer
// ========================================================================
//
// BlockConnection is a SINGLE CONVERSATION: it takes a live row, kills it and
// writes the two rules that stop that peer returning. It is deliberately narrow
// because the user names a row they saw, not a policy they want.
//
// FwRule is the general form underneath the same primitives - a rule scoped by
// direction, action, protocol, address, ports and process. It exists so the tool
// can express a policy the user states ("block this process", "block inbound
// from this subnet") rather than only a reaction to a row.
//
// THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES IT, and the reason an "allow" rule is not offered
// as a way to exclude a process: Windows Firewall's default conflict resolution
// is BLOCK WINS. Adding an allow rule for a process that an existing block rule
// also matches does NOT carve the process out of the block - the block still
// applies. Exclusion has therefore to be done by SCOPING the block (which is
// what the process field is for), or by having no block rule in the first
// place. This is not a limitation of this tool; it is how the platform behaves,
// and saying so is the difference between a user believing a peer is allowed
// when it is not.
//
// A second platform constraint, already measured and documented in BlockConn.cpp:
// a rule that restricts ports must have a CONCRETE protocol. Protocol = ANY
// rejects put_LocalPorts / put_RemotePorts with E_INVALIDARG, so a rule asking
// for ports with protocol "any" is refused here rather than silently created
// without its port restrictions.
