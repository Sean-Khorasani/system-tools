// ---- Filter expressions ----------------------------------------
// Grammar (space-separated tokens, AND semantics):
//   token    := ["exclude:"] clause
//   clause   := [direction ":"] [proto ":"] [field ":"] value
//   direction:= "local:" | "remote:"   -> which ENDPOINT a field refers to
//   proto    := "tcp:" | "udp:" | "ipv4:" | "ipv6:"
//   field    := local|remote|lport|rport|port|pid|process|path|
//               state|proto|host|service|cpu|mem|disk|rx|tx|net|
//               duration|speed|tls|country|asn
//   value    := text | number | lo "-" hi   (numeric for port/pid fields)
// `asn:` is deliberately BOTH: a bare number is a threshold on the AS number
// (`asn:15169` and the range `asn:15169-20000` work), and anything else is a
// substring of "AS<n> <org>", so `asn:cloudflare` finds the operator by name. One
// field, two kinds of value, because "which network is this?" is asked both ways
// and a user should not have to remember which spelling answers which.
// The live-stat fields (cpu/mem/disk/rx/tx/net) take a numeric THRESHOLD, not
// text: a bare number is MB (cpu: %), `K`/`M`/`G` suffixes multiply, a
// range is "lo-hi", and a bare value is a lower bound. So `mem:100` is "100
// MB or more", `tx:1GB` is "a gigabyte sent or more". A non-numeric value
// degrades to a text match, as it always did.
// Examples: chrome  port:443  exclude:remote:tcp:443  pid:1000-2000
//           state:estab  proto:udp  process:svchost  mem:100-500
//           local:port:80            -> LOCAL port equals 80
//           remote:tcp:443           -> remote port 443 on TCP
//           local:10.                -> local address contains "10."
//
// 'direction' and 'field' are separate concepts: "local:"/"remote:" select
// which endpoint, "lport:"/"rport:"/"local:" as a *field* name select which
// column. Treating one as the other is why local:port:80 used to parse into
// {field=Local, text="port:80"}, which can never match anything.
