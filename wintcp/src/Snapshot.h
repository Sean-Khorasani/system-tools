// Snapshot.h
// ONE connection-snapshot pipeline, shared by the GUI and the CLI.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. There used to be two implementations of "enumerate the
// machine's endpoints and fill in everything we know about them": the body of
// RefreshEngine::Run, and a private copy called BuildSnapshot in Cli.cpp. They
// were the same code written twice, and they had already drifted - the GUI
// samples per-process stats and can join traffic, the CLI copy did neither, so
// `--format full` printed em-dashes for every enriched column. A second copy of
// anything is a second thing to forget to update.
//
// The rule this file enforces: there is exactly one place that produces a
// snapshot, and no HWND appears anywhere in it. That is what makes the whole
// feature set reachable from a console, and what lets a command be tested
// without creating a window.
//
// THREADING. SnapshotSource is NOT thread-safe - it holds the process resolver
// and the CPU-baseline sampler, both of which carry state between passes by
// design. Give each thread its own instance. RefreshEngine owns one on its
// worker thread; the CLI owns one on its own thread; the selftests make their
// own. Copying the class is deliberately disallowed so nobody passes one
// across a thread boundary by value.
