// The libraries probed here, and WHY each one is a candidate at all:
//
//   crypt32.dll  Certificate subject/issuer for the TLS column. Genuinely
//                optional: it is absent from Nano Server and from some
//                container base images. NOTE the TLS column has no producer at
//                all today (see Connection.h), so nothing currently needs
//                crypt32 either; the probe is kept because the column is real
//                and this is the one dependency it would need beyond ws2_32.
//   pdh.dll      Disk read/write rates. Present since NT4, but the PhysicalDisk
//                counters are a DISMISSIBLE optional component ("Performance
//                Counters" in the Windows Features dialog) and are genuinely
//                off on stripped images - which is a different failure from a
//                missing DLL, and the report distinguishes them.
//   user32.dll   DPI awareness. GetDpiForWindow is Win10 1607+; Utils.cpp
//                already resolves it dynamically. Reported so a user on an
//                older build learns the window is unscaled rather than broken.
//   iphlpapi.dll MANDATORY - it owns GetExtendedTcpTable, which is how the app
//                enumerates connections at all. Probed only so that its
//                absence is reported as a hard error with an explanation
//                instead of an access violation at startup. Never delay-loaded.
//
// What is NOT here, deliberately: KERNEL32, USER32/GDI32's core, ADVAPI32
// (the registry IS the settings store), SHELL32, COMDLG32, COMCTL32, ole32,
// OLEAUT32 and ws2_32. All have shipped in every Windows SKU since XP
// including Server Core, and delay-loading them would buy no portability while
// costing a SEH-based failure mode at every call site - see SIZE-OPTIMIZATION.md
// section 7.3 for why "absent on some Windows" is not, for these, true.

// LoadLibrary used strictly as a PROBE of whether an optional system library
// is usable.
//
// WHY THE ERROR MODE IS SAVED AROUND IT: a DLL that exists but is not a valid
// image - a zero-byte file left beside the exe, a truncated download, bit-rot
// on an old install - does not make LoadLibraryA return NULL quietly. The
// loader raises the hard error STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT (0xC0000020) and
// the default handler puts a modal "Bad Image" message box on the desktop,
// naming the DLL. That box is modal, it is not about the feature being probed,
// and it fires every time a probe runs - so a diagnostic tool that is doing its
// job of reporting "this library is unusable" instead interrupts the user.
//
// SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS is what suppresses it; SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX
// covers the neighbouring open-failure path. The previous mode is OR-ed in
// rather than replaced, so flags another part of the process set are not
// dropped for the duration, and the original is restored on return. The mode
// is process-wide, so this is brief by construction: one LoadLibraryA and
// straight back. Nothing here changes what the probe RETURNS - LoadLibraryA
// still fails on a bad image, and the caller still sees "absent".
//
// Deliberately NOT LoadLibraryEx with LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_* flags: those need
// a KB2533623 on Win7 and would themselves become the compatibility problem
// this file exists to avoid.

//   WS2_32    sockets, and the DNS the resolver needs
//
// All seven have shipped in every Windows SKU since XP, including Server Core
