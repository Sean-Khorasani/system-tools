// FontCache.h
// One font per (DPI, point size, weight, family) for the whole process.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS: three top-level windows - the main window, the Details sheet and
// the charts window - each built their own GDI fonts. That is a DPI-change hazard
// in three directions rather than one: every window has to know it must rebuild,
// a window created before a DPI change starts life with the wrong metrics, and the
// details window holds a *copy* of the main window's handle that a rebuild must
// chase down or it dangles.
//
// The fix is not to be more careful in three places. It is for nobody to own a
// font: a caller asks for a HFONT and does NOT delete it, because the cache owns
// every handle it hands out and releases them all in one place when the DPI
// changes. A caller that deletes a cached handle breaks every other window.
//
// Lifetime: the cache is process-wide and never freed explicitly. GDI fonts are
// released by the process teardown, and a singleton that must be destroyed at
// exit would have to run after every window is gone - which is exactly the ordering
// that cannot be expressed.
//
// Not a GDI object leak: the handles are cached, not created per call. The bound
// is the number of distinct (DPI, size, weight, family) tuples the UI actually
// asks for, which is a handful.
