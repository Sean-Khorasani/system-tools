// A modal that lists the firewall rules `blocks` counts, with per-rule delete
// and "remove all". The rules come from ListBlockedRules (BlockConn.h), which
// reports what the firewall actually holds rather than what the ledger
// remembers, so a rule the user disabled or flipped to allow shows up as
// disabled rather than as protection.
//
// The LAYOUT is built in memory, the same as PromptDialog, and the bounds are
// pinned by a selftest in the same way: the writer refuses rather than
// overrunning, and the test drives it with deliberately small buffers. See the
// long note in PromptDialog.cpp for why a dialog template writer needs that
// treatment - the failure mode is an out-of-bounds read inside the dialog
// manager, which presents as an intermittent access violation rather than as a
// crash at the site that caused it.
//
// No HWND crosses this interface: MainWindow passes an owner and gets back
// what the user did, so nothing below this header depends on the window.
