// StreamCapture.h
// Drives pktmon to capture one TCP connection, converts the ETL to pcapng,
// parses it and reassembles the stream. This is the only part of
// the follow-stream feature that touches the filesystem or spawns processes.
//
// WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER:
//   1. pktmon filter remove        (the filter set is global and persistent)
//   2. pktmon filter add ... -t TCP -p <localport> -p <remoteport> [-i <ip>]
//   3. pktmon start --capture --pkt-size 0 --file-name <tmp>.etl
//   4. [caller shows a "capturing" window, the user browses for a few seconds]
//   5. pktmon stop                (flushes and merges the ETL)
//   6. pktmon etl2pcap <tmp>.etl --out <tmp>.pcapng
//   7. read + ParsePcapng + ReassembleStream
//   8. delete both temp files
//
// --pkt-size 0 is not optional: the default truncates each packet and a
// truncated stream cannot be reassembled. See todo.md 3.0.
