// WinCaps.h
// Runtime capability report: which optional Windows facilities this machine
// actually offers, and why not when it does not.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now the app answered "can I do X?" by trying X and
// interpreting the error, which is correct but invisible. Three separate
// modules each held their own private answer - `CaptureAvailable()` in
// StreamCapture.cpp, `SocketTrafficSampler::Supported()` in SocketTraffic.h,
// and a `pdhRetryIn_` countdown in SysStats.cpp - and none of them could be
// asked "so what CAN this machine do?". A user on a stripped Server Core or a
// Wine prefix who found the disk panel empty had no way to learn that the
// absence was a missing DLL rather than a bug, and no way to find out what
// would fix it.
//
// The point is not to make the app smaller. It is to make it HONEST: every
// degraded feature names its own cause, and every unavailable one says what to
// install. See SIZE-OPTIMIZATION.md section 7 for the size measurement that
// motivated gating the optional libraries behind /DELAYLOAD at all.
//
// One header, one definition, one report. Every module that owns an optional
// capability registers it here, so adding a dependency cannot be forgotten:
// the list of what this build might lack is the list of what it probes.

// One probed capability. 'what' is the user-facing feature name ("Disk I/O
// counters"), never a DLL name: the user does not know what pdh.dll is, and
// a report that says "pdh.dll missing" has told them nothing actionable.
// 'install' is the actionable half - the Windows feature or package that
// provides it - and is empty when there is nothing to install, which is a
// legitimate answer (see the notes on each capability).

// Probe every optional capability once and cache the answer. Cheap: each probe
// is one LoadLibrary of a DLL the loader already mapped, one function lookup, or
// - for the capture row added in 9.2.7 - two GetFileAttributes calls on exes
// that are always mapped into the loader's search path anyway.
//
// CALLED FROM exactly one place: BuildInfo.cpp's "This run" block, which both
// the CLI `version` command and the GUI About box render. That comment used to
// add "and from `stat`", which was false - `stat` prints a single fixed-width
// line and never builds a BuildSummary, so no capability row has ever appeared
// in it. Verified by running both: `stat` output is one line and contains no
// capability text. Correcting it here rather than adding the call, because
// `stat`'s line format is a fixed-width contract that a multi-line capability
// block would break, and no item asked for that.

// before its first call.
//
// WHY THIS MUST BE ASKED, not assumed. A /DELAYLOAD import resolves on FIRST
// CALL, not at process start, and a missing DLL then raises a structured
// delay-load exception rather than returning an error code. So delay-loading a
// library without gating its call sites converts "this feature is absent" -
// a clean, reportable condition - into a crash. The gate is what makes the
// absence a report.
//
// Deliberately a LoadLibrary probe rather than GetModuleHandle: the DLL is
// genuinely not loaded yet, which is the entire point of delay-loading it.
// The cost is one file-system lookup, once, and it is cached.
//
// Safe to call before the delay-load helper is ready - it does not touch any
// delay-loaded import itself.

// The one gate a delay-loaded subsystem's entry point should call. Returns
// true when the library is present and the caller should carry on; returns
// false after showing the standard notice when it is not.
//
// WHY ONE HELPER RATHER THAN FIVE INLINE CHECKS. comdlg32 alone has five
// entry points (export CSV/TSV/JSON, hex-dump save, change-log save, open a
// .mmdb). Written out five times, the guards would be five chances to word the
// message differently - and, worse, five chances to write `if (!DllAvailable)
// return;`, which on a missing library looks EXACTLY like the user cancelling
// the dialog. A dialog that silently declines to open is indistinguishable
// from a broken menu item, and is precisely the confusion the capability report
// exists to remove. Route every one of them here and the failure mode is
// unreachable by construction.
//
// The message names the feature first and the DLL second: the user asked to
// export a CSV, not to load comdlg32. Naming the DLL is still worth it in the
// parenthesis - someone debugging this needs it - but it is the detail, not
// the headline.
