// File: wintcp/src/GeoIp.h (c-header)
// GeoIp.h
// A read-only MaxMind DB (.mmdb) reader: address -> ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
// country code, for the Country column.
//
// WHY IT IS HERE RATHER THAN A LIBRARY: the published libmaxminddb is C, and
// the .mmdb file is the only input we have (the user drops one in). Parsing
// it in-tree keeps the build dependency-free and the failure mode under our
// control - the file is untrusted input, so every read in the implementation
// is bounds-checked against the loaded buffer.
//
// The file is read once into memory and kept there for the object's life.
// These are 1-500 MB files; a real map is not worth the lifetime rules here
// when the reader is owned by one object with an explicit Close().
//
// Nothing in this header throws. Load() reports through a return value and an
// out-parameter because the file is user-supplied and can be absent,
// truncated, or not a database at all - none of which are exceptional.
