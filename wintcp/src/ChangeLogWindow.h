// Live change log window: APPEAR / DISAPPEAR / STATE events
// shown as they happen, in a virtual ListView over a capped buffer of
// pre-formatted rows.
//
// WHY IT IS FED AND DOES NOT POLL: ConnectionStore::TakeChangeEvents()
// *drains* the change queue. A window that called it would take the events
// away from MainWindow::WriteChangeLog(), and the reverse is equally true -
// whoever asks first starves the other. So the main window keeps ownership
// of the drain and hands the same batch to both consumers; this window
// never touches the store. AppendEvents() is the whole interface.
//
// WHY THE BUFFER IS CAPPED: a busy machine emits thousands of change
// events a minute, and this is a rolling view, not the archive (the CSV
// file is the archive). kMaxEvents bounds the memory for the lifetime of
// the process and keeps the ListView's virtual index space small enough
// that a repaint is always cheap. Dropped events are counted and reported
// in the status line rather than silently forgotten.
//
// WHY THE ROWS ARE PRE-FORMATTED: every event is turned into its column
// strings once, when it arrives. Painting is then a pointer read, so a
// burst of thousands of events costs one repaint rather than thousands of
// formatting passes.
//
// WHY THE SCROLL FOLLOWS THE SCROLLBAR: the newest row is the useful
// default, but a log that yanks the view back to the bottom while you are
// reading is unusable. follow_ is therefore derived from where the user
// left the scrollbar, and only events that arrive *while the user is at the
// bottom* move the view.
