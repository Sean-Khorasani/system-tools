// Threshold alerting and change notifications.
//
// DESIGN RULE, and the reason this is a separate file: a network viewer that
// pops up a balloon every time a connection crosses a line becomes something
// the user switches off, and then it is useless for the one event that
// mattered. So:
//   * Alerting is MUTED BY DEFAULT. Nothing is ever shown until the user
//     turns it on.
//   * Each distinct condition fires ONCE and then goes quiet until it
//     clears. A connection sitting above the threshold does not re-notify
//     every refresh - that is a notification storm, and it is the single
//     most common way this kind of feature becomes noise.
//   * Balloons require the tray icon. If the user has tray disabled, alerts
//     fall back to the status bar rather than silently doing nothing.
//
// The evaluator is a pure function of the current row stats plus the previous
// state, so it is testable without a window and without a network.
