// TcpReasm.h
// Per-4-tuple TCP stream reassembly. Pure: no I/O, no windows.
//
// Takes the packet list from Pcapng and produces, for one connection, the
// two byte streams a "follow TCP stream" view needs - client-to-server and
// server-to-client - with retransmissions, out-of-order segments and overlap
// resolved by sequence number rather than by capture order.
//
// DESIGN NOTE - why sequence numbers and not capture order:
// pktmon reports each frame at more than one layer, so the same segment
// legitimately appears two or three times in the capture. Appending on
// arrival would triple every stream. Every segment is therefore placed by
// its sequence number, and a segment whose range is already covered is
// dropped as a duplicate. That also handles genuine retransmits, which are
// indistinguishable from the layer-duplicates at this level and which must
// likewise not be appended twice.
