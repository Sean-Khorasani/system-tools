// Group connection rows by process for display.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE MODULE. Grouping is pure logic over a row list - which
// process owns this set of rows, how many connections, how much traffic in
// total, what the aggregate state is - with no window in it. Keeping it here
// means it can be tested directly, which matters because the failure modes
// are silent: a group header that shows the wrong count, or an aggregate that
// reads "0 B" for a busy process, looks like a rendering bug and nobody can
// tell whether the arithmetic or the drawing is at fault.
//
// WHAT A GROUP IS. A group is ONE process (by PID) and every connection row
// that belongs to it. The rows themselves are untouched - grouping changes
// the *shape of the list*, never the data. A row keeps its stable id, its
// state, its addresses. This is what makes grouping safe to toggle: turning
// it off restores exactly the flat list, because nothing was consumed or
// merged to produce the groups.
//
// WHY BY PID AND NOT BY PROCESS NAME. Two processes can share a name
// (svchost.exe, and any user-launched copy). Grouping by name would merge
// unrelated processes and report traffic and connection counts for a
// "process" that does not exist. The name is a label on the group; the PID is
// its identity.

// value for a group of several.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is separate from GroupColumnText. Falling
// through to the representative connection is the RIGHT behaviour for an
// interactive table and for the GUI: the row is visibly a group (its State
// cell reads "4 connections"), so showing one member's remote address is
// informative rather than misleading, and blanking it would be strictly less
// useful. GroupColumnText returning false is that mechanism, and it is
// unchanged.
//
// It is the WRONG behaviour for `export`, because a delimited file's header
// row is a SCHEMA CLAIM: `Remote address` promises that every value under it is
// a remote address, and a reader has no way to know that one of four members
// was picked. Measured before this existed: `export --group --columns
// pid,process,remote` wrote a header saying "Remote address" over the single
// value "0.0.0.0" for a process with four connections. A spreadsheet loads
// that, the wrongness propagates, and nothing in the file says so.
//
// So the table/GUI keep the representative value, and `export` refuses the
// combination BY NAME (see CmdExport) rather than writing a file whose header
// over-claims. A named refusal is louder than a plausible wrong file, and this
// codebase's whole posture - see MissingEnrichmentAdvice and the D24 switch
// allow-lists - is that a silent wrong answer is the failure to design out.
//
// Note which columns are NOT here: cpu, mem and disk fall through to the
// representative but are perfectly correct for a group, because they are
// per-PROCESS values joined onto every row carrying the PID. A group row would
// print the same number either way; only genuinely per-connection columns are
// unsafe to fall through with.
