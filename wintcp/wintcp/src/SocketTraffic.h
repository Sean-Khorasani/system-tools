// SocketTraffic.h
// non-admin per-PID TCP byte totals.
//
// Windows exposes live per-PID network bytes to standard users through
// exactly one proven path: duplicate a process's socket handle into our
// process and read SIO_TCP_INFO (TCP_INFO_v0.BytesIn/BytesOut), which the
// kernel fills per socket without any privilege. This sampler walks the
// system handle table (SystemExtendedHandleInformation - undocumented but
// stable, the Process Explorer/Hacker lineage), duplicates only the socket
// handles of the PIDs that currently have connection rows, and folds the
// reads into cumulative per-PID totals with the same contract as the ETW
// source: ConnectionStore::SetTraffic(pid, rx, tx).
//
// State rules (see MergeSample, unit-tested via --selftest):
//  * a socket that disappears from a SCANNED process is retired into the
//    PID's total, so totals never drop when a connection closes;
//  * a handle value that comes back with SMALLER counters was reused for
//    a new socket - the old socket is retired first;
//  * a PID that loses its connection rows is forgotten entirely (PID
//    reuse cannot inherit another process's totals);
//  * a process that cannot be opened (protected/dead) keeps its last
//    known state instead of being misread as "all sockets closed".
//
// Limits, documented in README: TCP only (UDP sockets expose no byte
// counters), sockets that open+close entirely between two refreshes are
// missed, SIO_TCP_INFO needs Windows 10 1709+ (Supported() is false
// otherwise - the app then behaves exactly as before, i.e. needs admin).
