// Presets.h
// Saved views: the filter text, the visible-column mask, the sort column and
// direction, and the data-source toggles, stored per name under
// HKCU\Software\WinTCP\Presets\<name>.
//
// A preset is a settings store, not a scratch file. The registry has no undo,
// so nothing in here ever destroys a saved view implicitly: Save refuses to
// replace an existing name unless the caller says so, and reports which of
// the two happened.

// The captured view is a ViewState; PresetView is an alias for it.
//
// It used to be declared here as a separate struct, which is how a view ended
// up described twice: once in MainWindow's members and once here, with nothing
// keeping them equal. That is the same fault that shipped GeoIP and 5.1
// grouping as fully-tested dead code, so the second description is now gone
// rather than kept in sync. See ViewState.h.
//
// This header is the registry storage for a view, not its definition: what a
// view IS lives in ViewState.h, and what a preset persists lives in the
// kVal* schema below.

// Why a Save returned what it returned.
//
// The split between kExists and kOverwrote is the whole point of the
// contract, so it is worth being precise about it:
//
//   * Save() with the default argument NEVER writes over an existing preset.
//     On a name collision it writes nothing at all and returns kExists. The
//     caller decides - normally by asking the user - and then repeats the
//     call with allowOverwrite = true.
//
//   * kOverwrote is a *report*, not an error: it is returned only when the
//     caller has already opted in to replacing. A caller that has confirmed
//     the replacement treats it as success.
//
// So a caller that forgets the confirm cannot lose a view, and a caller that
// has performed it still gets told which of created/overwritten happened for
// its status text and change log. The alternative - Save always writing and
// merely *reporting* the collision - leaves the safety dependent on every
// call site remembering a prior Exists() check, which is exactly the kind of
// thing that survives a refactor and then eats somebody's saved view.
