// 9.2.10 - the portable `wintcp.ini` beside the executable.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. Settings live in HKCU, which is per user and per machine -
// so a copy of wintcp.exe on a USB stick carries no preferences with it. A
// `wintcp.ini` placed beside the exe is how the preferences travel.
//
// THE DESIGN DECISION, and it is the one that keeps this from being a trap.
// The ini supplies DEFAULTS only: it is applied BEFORE the registry is read,
// so an existing user's saved settings always win. The alternative - the ini
// overriding the registry - means a user who changes a setting in the GUI sees
// it silently revert on the next launch, which is the sort of bug that gets
// reported as "the app forgets my settings". With this ordering the ini is
// exactly "what to use on a machine I have never run this on", and a fresh
// install on a new machine picks it up while an existing install does not.
//
// A second decision: only the BEHAVIOUR preferences are in scope, not the
// whole Settings struct. Window placement, column widths and the column
// order are per-monitor, per-machine facts whose values mean nothing
// elsewhere - a window rectangle from a 4K display is wrong on a 1366x768
// laptop, and a column mask persisted with a different column count is a
// migration problem. Interval, auto-refresh, hostname resolution, always-on-
// top, tray and traffic-on are the ones that genuinely describe how someone
// wants the tool to behave.
//
// A STRICT reader, for the same reason as the bookmark and preset files: an
// ini that is accepted half is a preference that is half set. Pure over a
// string, so it is pinned by tests with no disk and no registry.
