// MSVC it both warns (C4293) and evaluates to 1, so the mask becomes 0 and
// ClampVisibleCols collapses every visible column to a single bit - a persisted,
// silent and catastrophic default that no "the default set is non-empty" test
// would catch, because 1 IS non-empty.
//
// F5.1-F5.3 took COL_COUNT from 29 to exactly 32, so this is now load-bearing
// rather than theoretical, and /WX turns the C4293 into a build failure - which
// is how it was caught. The 64-bit shift below is well defined at 32 and is cast
// back down; the assert is the reminder that a 33rd column needs the stored mask
// widened first, not just a bigger shift.

// chosen over widening, and this is the note saying so at the place a 33rd
// column would be added.
//
// Why freeze rather than widen:
//   - There is no 33rd column. Nothing today is blocked by this.
//   - Widening is not one change. It is at least eight: the UINT32 mask, the
//     registry value from REG_DWORD to REG_BINARY at 8 bytes, a
//     kCurrentColVersion 6 migration (with the v4 and v5 precedents to follow),
//     the IDM_COL range in resource.h, and ColumnTitle / GetColumnText /
//     CompareRows / JsonKeyFor / GroupedDefaultColumns, plus the
//     `help list --columns` prose and its golden asserts.
//   - Every one of those is a place a persisted user layout can change
//     silently, which is the failure mode nobody would think to test for.
//
// So a feature that needs a column reuses an existing one rather than growing
// the mask as a side effect. ASN (9.5.1) is the live case: it reuses Country.
// A 33rd column is a deliberate act - widen the mask and migrate first, in its
// own commit - not something that arrives with a feature.
//
// The assert above is the enforcement: it names this at the point of failure,
// so "add a column" cannot be completed without reading the reason.
