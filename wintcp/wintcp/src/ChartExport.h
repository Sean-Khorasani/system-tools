// A panel's zoom is a *sample window* (kLo/kHi indices into the history
// buffer) plus a *value window* (vLo/vHi, the range the plot maps top to
// bottom). That is everything a mouse wheel can touch: a wheel can only
// address a rectangular sub-range, it cannot rotate or re-sample anything,
// so "zoomed" is fully described by these two ranges and there is no
// separate factor that could drift out of sync with what is drawn.

//   * all samples identical, or no samples at all -> the panel has no real
