    // Why a column and not only a filter. D26 made `note:` searchable and the
    // CLI can print the note, but the GUI had no way to SEE one: the note lived
    // in the row and reached the screen only as a tooltip on the Bookmarks
    // column, which meant a note written on the command line was invisible to
    // the person using the app. A filter you cannot see the result of is half a
    // feature - "show me everything I annotated" answers the question, but
    // "which of these did I annotate, and why" needs the text on screen.

    // the structure. `ss -i` prints milliseconds, and these columns are named
    // for `ss -i`, so the value is converted on the way in (SocketTcpInfo) and
    // every consumer sees milliseconds. Reading the raw microseconds would
    // report a 12 ms round trip as 12000, and the error is invisible in a
    // table because the number still looks like a number.

// How one column is drawn in an aligned table (the CLI's default `format
// table`; the GUI's kColumns carries the same split as LVCFMT, so both
// surfaces read the same).
//
//   right - numeric columns align right so digits stack under the header;
//           everything else is text and aligns left. Mirrors the GUI's
//           LVCFMT_RIGHT set exactly (ports, PID, the stat columns).
//   cap   - a width BUDGET, in display columns, for cells whose final value
//           is not knowable when the column header is printed: they are
//           filled by a late enrichment join (dns/traffic) or by the clock
//           (duration). The aligned header prints before those run (D15),
//           so the column takes this fixed width instead of its content's,
//           and a cell that overflows it truncates with an ellipsis. 0 =
//           the width is measured from the content (snug).
//
//           A budget is the EXCEPTION, not the rule, and only exists where
//           a late value can exceed the header's own width: the Country
//           column is the counter-example - GeoIP writes an ISO 3166-1
//           alpha-2 code (always 2 columns), which the 7-column "Country"
//           header already covers before any join runs, so it measures
//           snug and can never fall out of step with a streamed header.
//           Every column the snapshot itself fills (Process, Path, CPU,
//           Memory, Disk, ...) measures snug too: its cells are present
//           before the header is printed.
