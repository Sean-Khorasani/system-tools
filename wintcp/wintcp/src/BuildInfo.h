// BuildInfo.h
// Build summary (7.5) and the keyboard-shortcut sheet (7.6).
//
// Both are text assembled from live state rather than hard-coded strings,
// which is the whole point: a shortcut sheet that is written out by hand goes
// stale the moment someone adds F7, and a build summary that hard-codes
// "elevation: no" is wrong for the one user who cares - the one running as
// administrator. Both read the same source of truth the rest of the app uses
// (Version.h, the resource ids, the live capability probes), so they cannot
// drift from what the program actually does.
//
// The shortcut list is DATA, not text. ShortcutsText() renders it, and the
// selftest renders the same list, so adding a shortcut without documenting it
// - or documenting one that does not exist - is caught by a test rather than
// discovered by a user.
