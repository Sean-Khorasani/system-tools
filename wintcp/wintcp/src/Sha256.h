// 9.5.7 - SHA-256 over a file image, plus the helpers the details view needs.
//
// WHY A LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION AND NOT BCrypt. Windows ships SHA-256 in
// bcrypt.dll, and in principle one call would do: BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider
// -> BCryptCreateHash -> BCryptHashData -> BCryptFinishHash. In practice this
// tool runs its hash on a path the user just picked, in a Details window that
// must never pop a dialog, and the path is frequently one the process cannot
// open with FILE_READ_DATA - a protected system binary. So the failure paths
// are half the value, and a local implementation keeps them explicit and
// testable. It is also ~300 lines against the alternative's five stateful
// calls, which is a fair trade at this size.
//
// If a future change wants BCrypt after all, the contract below is the one to
// keep: a pure Sha256Bytes over memory, a HashImageWithReason that never lies
// about why it failed, and a hex formatter with no locale in it.
//
// SHA-256 is FIPS 180-4. This implementation is the straightforward one
// (64-round compression over 512-bit blocks, 64-entry round constants,
// big-endian lengths, the 0x80 pad plus a length suffix). It is correct by
// construction and pinned by the FIPS test vectors in testAssemblies/Bench.cpp
// so a future edit cannot quietly break it.
