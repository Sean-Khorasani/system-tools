// 9.2.10 - preset export and import.
//
// The sibling of BookmarkFile: a preset is a ViewState, and ViewState is a
// value, so a preset file is a value too. That is what makes the codec pure -
// no registry, no store, no window - which is what lets the file format be
// pinned by tests rather than by trying it.
//
// Same design and the same refusal rules as the bookmark file, and for the
// same reasons. The reader is STRICT rather than general: a parser that
// accepts anything accepts a malformed file, and loading half of a preset
// leaves a view the user never saved - which is worse than refusing, because
// it is subtle and it is *believed*.
