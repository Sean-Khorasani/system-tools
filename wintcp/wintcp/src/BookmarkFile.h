// 9.2.10 - bookmark export and import.
//
// Bookmarks live in HKCU, which is the wrong shape for the three things a
// user actually wants to do with them: move them to another machine, keep
// them in a dotfiles repo, and edit them as text. This module is the file
// format that does those things - a JSON document with an explicit schema
// version, plus a strict reader for it.
//
// WHY A STRICT READER AND NOT A GENERAL JSON PARSER. The reader accepts
// exactly the Version=1 bookmark schema and nothing else. That is deliberate:
// a parser that accepts anything accepts a malformed file, and importing half
// a bookmark file is worse than importing none - a user who thinks their
// bookmarks moved and finds three of forty is the failure this is designed to
// make impossible. A partial import is refused in full rather than in part.
//
// The reader also refuses the whole document when a record is missing a
// required field or carries one of the wrong type. That mirrors the
// all-or-nothing rule Bookmarks::Load already applies per entry, extended to
// the file as a whole, and it is what makes an import safe to run unattended.
