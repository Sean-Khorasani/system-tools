// UAC self-elevation.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// The original plan was "read the live TLS session with
// SIO_TLS_INFO". That was checked against the Windows SDK and it does not
// exist: neither SIO_TLS_INFO nor TLS_INFO_v0 appears anywhere in the
// Windows Kits or Visual Studio trees, and TCP_INFO_v0/v1 carry no TLS
// field. So there is no unelevated way to learn that a live connection is
// TLS. See todo.md.
//
// That leaves two real options, and this module serves the first: run
// elevated and get the answer from ETW Schannel, which observes the
// handshake as it happens. The second is the pktmon capture,
// which also needs elevation.
//
// ELEVATION POLICY - read this before changing it
//   * Elevation happens ONLY when the user explicitly asks for a feature
//     that needs it (Follow TCP stream, ETW TLS). The app does not
//     self-elevate at launch. A connection viewer that demands admin
//     before it will show you your own connections is hostile.
//   * We do NOT shell out to a second process. The whole point is to keep
//     one window, one state, one set of columns. Instead the EXISTING
//     process re-launches itself with a marker argument and exits; the new
//     elevated instance is the real one. See ReelevateIfNeeded().
//   * If the account is a standard user, there is nothing to elevate to.
//     We say so and carry on unelevated rather than looping on a consent
//     dialog the user cannot satisfy.

// services) fails with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED even for an Administrator.
